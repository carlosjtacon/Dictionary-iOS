# Dictionary for iPhone
Forked from [Dictionary++](https://github.com/josh-/DictionaryPlusPlus) a simple interface to iOS's system dictionary, inspired by [Dictionary+](http://iphone.qualityindex.com/apps/571492/dictionary).

This app violates the App Store [rules](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uireferencelibraryviewcontroller), so you'll need to compile and install it on your devices yourself using XCode. Dictionary++ Licensed under the [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
